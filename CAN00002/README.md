#CAN


CAN is an academic search engine that provides evaluating spider charts, related searches, and the five most recommended papers of input keywords. The searching results are based on the google scholar database.

#Background

As freshmen, we felt confused about finding an appropriate topic for projects, so we hope that there is an app that can help us to evaluate the quality and quantity of academic resources of a topic, and gives us some inspiration.


#Install

##This project need Pycharm 
(Install link: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac)

and python packages: 
```urllib lxml numpy ssl flask ```
Please make sure you have locally installed these stuff.

Install the whole CAN folder. 

#Usage

Open the CAN file “As Pycharm project” .
Run the file “app.py”. 
Then open the localhost server shown in terminal and do the search.

#Q&A
##1
Q: Localhost server doesn’t appear after running the program

A: Check whether the block at the upper right corner is running “app”, not other files.
##2
Q: A red sentence that “DataCrawling Error” is shown on the screen on the page.

A: The most common reason for this is Google blocked our program to avoid heavy traffic of google scholars. Just wait for a minute and try it again.
